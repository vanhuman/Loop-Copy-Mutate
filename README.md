# loop-copy-mutate
Loop/Copy/Mutate project of Genetic Choir

This year, the Genetic Choir is launching a new project: Loop – Copy – Mutate. These three words point to the core aspects of human experience across the domains of evolution, digital communication and artistic expression. They are also the fundamental elements of composition for both electronic and improvising musicians.

The loop in electronic music and the simple repetition of someone else’s utterance have a common primordial cousin: the natural echo. An echo is the fundamental affirmation of both your presence in space and your connection to other people. But when there are many echoes – layers-upon-layers of reactions and interpretations – echoes can become a cacophony in which we lose ourselves. How to reclaim a sense of meaning, but also a sense of position, a definition of where you stand in respect to other people and meanings, in a world that is filled with response upon response is a central question in this project.

In an increasingly programmed world, this project will emphasize the human connection and sense of meaning that can be created between potentially countless numbers of participants in a digital environment. This connection will be made through the power of the human voice, harnessed within a smartphone app. The app will offer a first-hand experience of the Genetic Choir’s creative process as well as serve as the basis for a concert series, connecting users with the Genetic Choir in a live setting of instantly composed music.

We invite electronic musicians, digital sound programmers and concert organizers to collaborate with us on this project. Please direct any inquiries to Meagan Hughes: meagan.mtbc@gmail.com
