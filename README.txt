LOOP-COPY-MUTATE | SampleStation

The SampleStation is a Mac OS X application for collaborative play. Up to 4 players can use a gamepad or joystick to play together with a set of samples gathered by the Genetic Choir for the LOOP-COPY-MUTATE project. The application can also be played by just using your computer mouse.

Currently the SampleStation can be used with the following game devices:

Gravis Destroyer Tiltpad
Logitech Wingman Rumblepad
Logitech Attack 3
Thrustmaster Firestorm Wireless Gamepad

Check out the Config-template.scd file for settings. Run the code in SampleStationSetup.scd to start the application.
Dependencies: the wslib quark and the rvhLib library (https://github.com/vanhuman/rvhLib-1).
