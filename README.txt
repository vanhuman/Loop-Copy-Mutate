LOOP-COPY-MUTATE | SampleStation

The SampleStation is a Mac OS X application for collaborative play. Up to 4 players can use a gamepad or joystick to play together with a set of samples gathered by the Genetic Choir for the LOOP-COPY-MUTATE project. The application can also be played by just using your computer mouse.

Currently the SampleStation can be used with the following game devices:

Gravis Destroyer Tiltpad
Logitech Wingman Rumblepad
Logitech Attack 3
Thrustmaster Firestorm Wireless Gamepad

If you want to have the SampleStation adapted to another game device, please contact the developer at robert@west28.nl. No promises.
